# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emissions Dashboard (Tableau)
This is my first Tableau project, created as part of the Maven Analytics Guided Project.
The goal was to visualize global CO₂ emissions using a mix of charts that highlight emissions by country, population, and over time.

📊 Dashboard Overview
The final Tableau dashboard includes:

Bubble Chart: CO₂ emissions vs. population

Choropleth Map: CO₂ emissions per capita by country

Line Chart: Emission trends from 1750 to recent years

Interactive Filters: Country and year selection for comparisons

🔍 Key Insights
USA emits far more than its population share, both in total and per person.

China leads in total emissions but is mid-range per capita.

India, despite its large population, has low emissions per person.

Over time, emissions leadership has shifted: UK → USA → China.
